README


This folder should contain the xSPDE folder and Examples folder.

Set your Matlab path to include this folder and subfolders.

Run Examples/Batchtest.m to test operation.

XSPDE runs best combined with the Matlab parallel toolbox.

If you have no parallel toolbox, set ensembles(3) = 1 in the examples.

Happy xspde-ing.
