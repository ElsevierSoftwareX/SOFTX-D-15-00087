Changes that are included in xSPDE1.05


(1) wtph  is deleted, all Fourier transforms now done without phase factors

(2) r.kg is  deleted, as momentum axes are computed only when needed.

(3) A bug on reading .h5 files for multi-dimensional data is fixed.

(4) Any number of dimensions are supported, with corresponding documentation

(5) The xint, xd, and xave functions are improved so they behave more consistently

(6) Number attributes are labeled as r.nspace (etc) for compatibility with .h5 files.
