README


To install xSPDE, just download the main folder.

It should contain: the xSPDE folder, Examples folder, and  XspdeManual.pdf documentation. 

Set your Matlab path to include the folder and subfolders.

Run Examples/Batchtest.m to test operation.

XSPDE runs best combined with the Matlab parallel toolbox.

If you have no parallel toolbox, set ensembles(3) = 1 in the examples.
